## 🛠️ What I'm Working On

- **AutoAdaptAI**:  
  A command-line tool that uses AI to break down videos — detects objects, transcribes speech, and summarizes the content. Built with PyTorch, Whisper, HuggingFace and Transformers.
    
  → _Making AI pipelines practical, modular, and reusable._

- **StatPulseAI**:  
  A full-stack sports stats prediction platform that forecasts whether an NBA, NFL, or MLB player will go over or under a custom stat threshold using real-time data. Built with PyTorch, Kafka, and Kubernetes. Models are trained on live and historical stats (via balldontlie + ESPN scraping), and predictions are served through a FastAPI backend and a modern React frontend.
  
  → _End-to-end AI model & analyzer for real-time player stat forecasting — fully modular, scalable, and production-ready._

## 🧪 Some Things I've Done

- **At Outamation**: Built AI pipelines that could read and understand mortgage documents using NLP + Computer Vision. Added Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LlamaIndex for better search.

- **At Cisco**: Helped build cognitive radio systems by combining machine learning with software-defined radio. Worked on wave analysis and model tuning to make spectrum usage smarter.
